          <p id="biography">My passion for the arts started when I was a little girl, and although I developed my drawing skills at a young age, I took a different path when I finished school. I graduated from Law and Political Sciences at the University of Lima, and it wasnâ€™t until I moved to Chile in 2014 that I reconnected with this old hobby and regained my affinity for drawing and painting. I attended several workshops in Santiago, Chile and continued learning about the Visual Arts when I moved back to Lima, Peru in 2018. I enjoy working with mixed techniques , and most of my work is made with a mix of  oil, acrylic, charcoal and pencil.</p>

          <p id="objectives">My objective is finding the harmony between figurative painting and abstract shapes. These merge into images that try to capture the beauty of the female shape, and my intent is for the viewer to get caught in the emotions of awe and admiration, filled with the idea of finding perfection in something so mundane. I got inspired by women I look up to, and so I try to convey the confidence and flawlessness I perceive in them in my representations.</p>
